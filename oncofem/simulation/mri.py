    MRI is the base class for the pre-processing of the patient-specific input data. Herein, the measures of an input
    state are sorted and the basic structural modalities are available via the respective attribute. In order to 
    homogenize and further pre-process more attributes about image properties and masks of tumor and brain tissue 
    compartments are hold. Each sub-module for a particular task is bind via its respective attribute.

    *Attributes*:
