    MRI is the base class for the pre-processing of the patient-specific input data. Herein, the measures of an input
    state are sorted and the basic structural modalities are available via the respective attribute. In order to 
    homogenize and further pre-process more attributes about image properties and masks of tumor and brain tissue 
    compartments are hold. Each sub-module for a particular task is bind via its respective attribute.

    *Attributes*:
        work_dir:           String of the working directory, is set by optional state or manually
        t1_dir:             String, direction of t1 modality
        t1ce_dir:           String, direction of t1ce modality
        t2_dir:             String, direction of t2 modality
        flair_dir:          String, direction of flair modality
        seg_dir:            String, direction of segmentation
        full_ana_modality:  Bool, check if all structural modalities are given (t1, t1ce, t2, flair)
        affine:             Array of image affine, each modality is co-registered to that
        shape:              Shape of the image each modality is co-registered to
        ede_mask:           Binary mask image of the edema
        act_mask:           Binary mask image of the active core
        nec_mask:           Binary mask image of the necrotic core
        wm_mask:            Binary mask image of the white matter
        gm_mask:            Binary mask image of the gray matter
        csf_mask:           Binary mask image of the cerebro-spinal fluid
        state:              Respective input state. If initialised measures are load, full modality is checked and 
                            affine is set automatically

    *Methods*:
        set_affine:             Loads first given measurement and takes affine and shape
        load_measures:          Fills the respective arguments of the structural images and the segmentation
        isFullModality:         Checks if input state has full structural modality
        image2array:            Gives numpy array of image data
        image2mask:             Creates a mask of a given input image
        cut_area_from_image:    Cuts an area from an image
        set_state:              Sets state with working directory, loads measures, checks full modality and sets the 
                                affine.
